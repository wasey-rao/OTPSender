📱 OTP Forwarder — Jetpack Compose + Hilt + Retrofit

A secure and smart Android utility app that automatically reads incoming OTP messages and forwards them either via SMS to selected contacts or through a secure API to a server.
Built with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and Retrofit, it emphasizes privacy, user control, and modern Android architecture.

🚀 Features

🔐 Automatic OTP Detection
Continuously monitors incoming SMS and detects OTP codes using regex matching.

👥 Contact Management
Add or remove trusted contacts to forward OTPs automatically.

🌐 Server Integration
Sends OTPs to your backend via a REST API using Retrofit.

📲 Smart Forwarding Control
Toggle forwarding to SMS or Server independently with easy Compose switches.

💬 Last OTP Log
Displays the most recent detected OTP and sender name (if available).

🎨 Modern UI
Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, following a clean dark green + charcoal gray theme.

🧠 Clean Architecture + Hilt DI
Repository + ViewModel layers for easy testing and maintenance.

⚙️ Permissions Required

The following permissions are required for full functionality:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />


⚠️ These must also be requested at runtime for Android 7.0 (API 24) and above.

🧪 How It Works

Incoming SMS Detected → ContentResolver queries the latest SMS.

OTP Extracted → Regex identifies numeric OTP codes (4–8 digits).

Contact Name Lookup → Matches phone number with stored contacts.

Forwarding Actions

If SMS Forwarding is enabled → OTP sent to selected contacts.

If Server Forwarding is enabled → OTP posted to the configured API endpoint.

Log Updated → The last OTP and sender appear on the app screen.

🧰 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/wasey-rao/OTPSender.git


Open in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or newer).

Update the API base URL inside NetworkModule.kt:

private const val BASE_URL = "https://your-server-url.com/api/"


Grant required permissions manually (or implement a runtime permission flow).

Build and run on a physical device (SMS permissions don’t work on emulator).

📡 API Example

Expected endpoint:

POST /receive-otp
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "otp": "123456",
  "sender": "Bank XYZ",
  "timestamp": 1730000000000
}

🔒 Privacy Notes

The app only reads OTP messages from the SMS inbox, not personal conversations.

Contacts are stored locally and never uploaded.

Server communication is done via secure HTTPS.
